# music_genre_classification
This project uses machine learning to accurately classify music genres. Key components include collecting and preprocessing audio data, extracting features like MFCCs, and training models such as SVMs, KNNs, random forests, and deep learning networks. Models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy and F1-score, with hyperparameter tuning for optimization. The final model will be deployed as a user-friendly application for real-time genre classification. Future enhancements include expanding the dataset and refining models for improved accuracy. This project aims to showcase machine learning's potential in music classification.
